# PS: Nova Translations
Welcome to the PS: Nova Translations Github Repository.

This repository is dedicated to translating PS: Nova game texts from Japanese to English. We hope our disclosing of game texts and opening this repository will pave a quicker way for non-Japanese speaking ARKS to enjoy the game in their native languages in the future.

## Contributions

 1. Click the file you want to edit
 2. Click the pencil icon
 3. Edit the file to your heart's content!
 4. Write a brief summary of the changes at the bottom of the page
 5. Hit "Commit changes" (<b>DO NOT CREATE A NEW BRANCH, COMMIT DIRECTLY TO MASTER.</b>)
 6. Your changes will also be posted to the discord chat

 
##For the story translations:
  
Please <b>OVERWRITE</b> the JP text with your translation. Note that there may be "weird" things in the text!

For example, "[c]" and "[n]". The n is a "new line". <b><i><u>PLEASE LEAVE THESE TAGS IN THERE.</b></i></u>

The [ruby] tag indicates that the text inside of it will be above the enclosed text. For example:

```
msg_100000010010013.rmd:
お願い……わたしの[ruby ほし]惑星[/ruby]を……助けて。
```

will show up as:

```
               ほし
お願い……わたしの惑星を……助けて。
```

<b><i><u>PLEASE LEAVE THESE TAGS IN THERE.</b></i></u>

##For all other files: 

Please put your translation in the "Text" field like so:
  
```
  "310040": {
    "OriginalText": "ポストアタック",
    "Text": "Post Attack"
  },
```

We welcome your contributions in form of direct commits. You may create new issues to discuss the translations with other translators. Please note that issues not related to translation may be deleted without notice.
