# PS: Nova Translations
Welcome to the PS: Nova Translations Github Repository.

This repository is dedicated to translating PS: Nova game texts from Japanese to English. We hope our disclosing of game texts and opening this repository will pave a quicker way for non-Japanese speaking ARKS to enjoy the game in their native languages in the future.

## Contributions

 1. Click the file you want to edit
 2. Click the pencil icon
 3. Edit the file to your heart's content! (<b>ONLY EDIT THE JAPANESE, DO NOT CHANGE THE ENGLISH TEXT!</b>)
 4. Write a brief summary of the changes at the bottom of the page
 5. Hit "Commit changes" (<b>DO NOT CREATE A NEW BRANCH, COMMIT DIRECTLY TO MASTER.</b>)
 6. Your changes will also be posted to the discord chat

We welcome your contributions in form of direct commits. You may create new issues to discuss the translations with other translators. Please note that issues not related to translation may be deleted without notice.

Here is an example:

```
msg_11002.rmd
11002:
アイテム
```

would become:

```
msg_11002.rmd
11002:
Item
```
